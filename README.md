## What this app does
This simple React app uses a specific .csv file (provided in the repo and the link below) to generate a table of records. After clicking a table row it shows a map with the crime's location. It doesn't do anything else really.

## CSV file
In order for the app to work you need to download the "SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv" file included in this repo or download its longer version from the link below.

Crime records .csv file in this repo is just a fragment of the original one. I made it shorter due to some performance issues, so there's still some work to be done here.

Last time I checked I couldn't see any files in the glitch project. Propably glitch is having some issues with deploying a project directly from the github repo. For the time being to see the source code you need to visit https://github.com/Jaboleo/crime-map.

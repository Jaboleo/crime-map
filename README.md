In order for the app to work you need to download a SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv file included in this repo or download its longer version from the link below.
Crime records .csv file in this repo is just a fragment of the original one. I made it shorter due to some performance issues, so there's still some work to be done here.
**Link to the original file: http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv**

**Check this project deployed on glitch.com : https://jaboleo-crime-map.glitch.me/**
Last time I checked I couldn't see any files in the glitch project. Propably some issues with deploying a project directly from the github repo. For the time being to see the source code you need to visit https://github.com/Jaboleo/crime-map.
